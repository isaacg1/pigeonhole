# Problem

The Pidgeonhole formula states that if you have n+1 birds in n holes, it is impossible for each hole to contain one bird.
We are interested in proofs of unsatisfiability for this formula.

Cook wrote a [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1008335.1008338) in 1976 about this problem.
He gave an encoding of the problem with O(n^3) clauses,
which we can call PHP(n).
